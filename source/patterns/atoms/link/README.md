# Links

## Default

The default is the link style from Bootstrap. Links are not underlined by default but are underlined on hover.

## Underlined

Using the ```link-underlined``` class on the link (or the ```links-underlined``` on a container), we can add an underline for the link's default state. On hover, the thickness of the underline doubles to indicate the user interaction.

## Animated Underline

Using the ```link-animate-underline``` class on the link (or the ```links-animate-underline``` on a container), we can add an animated underline for the link's hover state. The default link style will still not have text decoration. This pattern comes from [CodePen](https://codepen.io/shshaw/pen/pdyJBW).

## Arrows

Using additional classes on a link, we can add an animated arrow on hover. Classes control the direction of the arrow. The default state is to have no text decoration.
