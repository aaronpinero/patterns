# Image Lazy Loading

This script is adapted from the [Google Developer Web Fundamentals article](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video) on lazy loading images and video. The lazy loading of an image in this component is triggered by the presense of the `data-lazyimage` attribute of the `<img>` tag.
