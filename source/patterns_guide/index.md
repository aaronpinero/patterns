title: Welcome to the TyBs Pattern Library
order: 1
---

The goal of this project is to provide a set of modern UI patterns. These patterns are based on [Tyfy Bootstrap](https://github.com/aaronpinero/typography-bootstrap) (**TyBs**; a themed version of Bootstrap 4) but go beyond the basics by adding enhanced styles, animation, and iteractivity.

Using **Tyfy Bootstrap** as a basis for this project provides a number of default patterns that don't need to be recreated or documented. In terms of atomic design, using Bootstrap allows me to build off of its many atoms, molecules, and organisms. This project aims to evolve some of those patterns as well as provide new molecules, organisms, layouts, and pages.
