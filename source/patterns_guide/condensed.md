This pattern library includes **League Gothic**, an open source font from [League of Moveable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic). In addition to being a personal favorite, League is an excellent narrow typeface. It is used in this library where it is advantageous to have a very narrow typeface -- such as in the infodial and fact molecules.

I chose to include the font rather than reference a webfont through a service like Google Fonts. This way the font is always available.
